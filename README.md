### Purpose

This program was made in partial fulfillment of the course CS121 - Programming Languages.

### Overview

The program has a simple UI built that enables users to enter their inputs. Afterwards, this will be processed by the program after the user has clicked the 'Tokenize' button. Output will then be shown in the token and granular sections. 

### Key Features
- **Text Analysis**: Although simple, the program is capable of distinguishing strings of texts, alphanumerics, special characters, and its delimeter colon (:).
- **Interactive UI**: The program's interface is capable of adjusting to the user's window size.
